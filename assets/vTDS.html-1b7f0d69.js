Two water level probes immersed in water at the same time are too close to each other, which will affect the monitoring results.</li><li>Set temperature compensation in APP.</li><li>In the APP, use a professional TDS pen to calibrate.</li></ul>',10),n=[r];function s(c,h){return t(),i("div",null,n)}const m=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","vTDS.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
